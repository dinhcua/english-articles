Today, I want to share with you about money and how to manage it.

Have you ever seen someone who earns a lot of money but saves nothing? And someone who doesn't earn much but can become rich?

It seems easy for rich people to make money. They have money, and they make more money. But for people who don't have much money, everything is hard.

Why is this happening? Is it because rich people have better chances? No, it's not just about chances. It's about how they think.

For example, a rich person with a little money will think about how to manage it. But a poor person might think managing money is not for them because they don't have much money to manage.

But a famous book about money says something important. If you worry about money, if you only think about saving and cutting spending when you don't have enough, and if you think you need to wait until you have a lot of money to learn about managing it, then these thoughts will make you worry more and have less money.

To change your money situation, you need to change how you think. Think about things you have never thought about before. Then you can have a different life.

The person who wrote this book is a famous businessman from Europe. He was in debt when he was 26 years old. Then, he decided to manage his money. He made a plan and followed it. In less than four years, he got out of debt and became rich.

His ideas about managing money can help many people understand money better. This book is interesting because it's like a fairy tale about money.

At first, the writer wanted to teach children how to understand and use money correctly, instead of letting money control them. But after the book came out, many adults liked it too. It became a bestseller in Europe and was translated into many languages.

Many adults wrote letters saying that the story in the book helped them understand how to manage money and become rich.

If you were born in a normal family or a poor family, if you want to learn how to manage money and earn more, if you want to get rid of money problems, you can start by learning basic but very useful money management from this fairy tale book for children.

Now, let's listen to the story today.

**To manage money, first, you need to wait for things you want.**

The story starts with a girl named Kira. Kira's family had money problems. They might lose their house because of money. Kira wanted a dog, but she knew her parents were worried about money, so she didn't ask for one.

One day, Kira found a white dog that was hurt. She took it home and took care of it. She couldn't find the owner, so her family kept it. Kira loved the dog very much and named it Money.

One year later, Kira was 12 years old. Her family was still not doing well. Her parents had to work hard to pay back money. Kira got less pocket money than before.

One day, Kira was watching TV and saw her favorite music band had a new CD. She really wanted it! She forgot about money and wanted to order it.

Suddenly, she heard a voice, "Kira, you should think again. Do you really have enough money? If you buy this CD, you will not have pocket money for this month."

Kira was surprised and looked around. She only saw her dog, Money, sitting there. She thought she was imagining things. She continued to order the CD.

Then, she heard the voice again, "Kira, you need to control yourself, or you will be poor soon."

This time, Kira was shocked. The voice came from her dog, Money!

Kira was scared, but Money said, "Don't be scared. You need to fight the wish to buy things now."

It turned out that Money was not a normal dog. It could talk and was an expert in managing money! This special expert told Kira and us something very important: If you want to be rich, you need to be able to stop yourself from buying things you want right away. You need to wait.

How many times have we spent money because we wanted something right away? We have many reasons to spend money. Sometimes we think, "It's just a little money, it's okay." But all these small amounts of money add up.

To manage money, the first step is to learn to wait for things you want.

A psychologist said that waiting for things you want means giving up small happiness now for bigger and better things later.

But some people might ask, "How do I know what wants to stop? Life is important for living. We also need to enjoy life. Some things we need to buy to live. Some things if we don't buy now, we will miss forever. If we save too much, what's the point of living?"

Actually, waiting for things you want is not about stopping all your needs. It's about making smart choices and giving up some things that stop you from reaching your big goals in the future.

In the process of saving money, wanting too many things will stop you from being rich. Only by learning to wait for things you want and spending less on things you don't really need can you become free from money worries.

So, Money the dog said, to wait for things in the right way, you need to know your big goals in life.

The reason why many people fail is that they cannot focus on one thing.

Kira was surprised but listened to Money carefully. Money said seriously, "From today, we will only talk about one thing: How to make money."

Money started to teach Kira. First, "Write down 10 things you want to have when you have a lot of money." After Kira finished the list, Money asked her to take away seven things and keep only three most important things.

Kira argued, "No, I cannot take away any of them!"

Money said seriously, "Only one clear goal can push you forward."

A researcher interviewed many homeless people and asked why they didn't work. The answer was surprisingly the same: they didn't have any real wishes they wanted to achieve.

The researcher said that being alive is connected to goals, and only goals can give you energy to work. If you only work for your boss, it's hard to earn more money. If you start a business just because of a sudden idea, you might stop quickly. Only when you have clear goals can you overcome problems when making money.

Everything needs to be about your goals. Don't waste energy on things that are not important to your goals. If you make your wishes clear, the road you walk will be clearer.

Clear goals help you focus on one thing for a long time. Someone said that most people fail in life because they live without direction and don't know where to go. The only reason is that they keep changing their direction in life. If you can focus your thoughts, energy, and mind in one direction and keep going for a long time, you will find the meaning of life. If you spend most of your time and energy on one thing, it's hard not to succeed.

Back to Kira and Money. Money continued to teach Kira how to reach her important goals in three steps:

Step 1: Look at your wish list every day. This will remind you of your goals. You can also make a dream album. Find pictures of things you want and put them in the album. Looking at them often will encourage you to find ways to make your dreams come true.

Step 2: Get a piggy bank and put some money in it every day to prepare for making your dreams come true.

Step 3: Besides dreams, you also need to believe in yourself. So, you need to prepare a notebook and write down things you did successfully every day, even if they are small things. This is called a success journal. It can help you build self-confidence a lot.

**Making Money is About Helping Others Solve Problems**

Kira listened to Money and made her goal list shorter, keeping only three things. She started to use two piggy banks and put her wishes on them. Kira also started a success journal. Everything was ready, but she still didn't see any chances to make money. She worried, "I am just a kid, how can I make money?"

Money said, "Don't always think you cannot do it. You need to find chances from what other people need."

The dog told Kira about a boy in America named Daria. At 8 years old, he started making money by delivering newspapers and taking out trash for neighbors. At 9, he started writing ads using his dad's computer. Soon, he had saved a lot of money. Then he started making TV shows. At 17, he was a millionaire.

After hearing this story, Kira was inspired and asked her cousin Marcel for advice. Although he was only one year older than Kira, he had become rich.

Her cousin told Kira that there are chances to make money everywhere. Marcel found out that many families wanted to eat bread on Sundays, but they didn't want to go out on holidays. So, he decided to deliver bread to homes every Sunday. Bread on Sunday was more expensive than on normal days. By working only a few hours a day, he earned 140 marks a month. Also, every afternoon, he went to a nursing home to help old people buy things or walk with them. The nursing home paid him 10 marks an hour. Each month, he could earn almost 300 marks.

Her cousin also told Kira that to find chances, you need to help other people and do things you like and can do. If Kira liked playing with dogs, why not walk dogs for other people?

It was a great idea! Kira knew most of the dogs in her neighborhood, and she liked them. There was a dog named Napoleon from Mr. and Mrs. Henkam, an old couple. Mr. Henkam had trouble walking, so only Mrs. Henkam walked the dog, but she didn't know how to train and play with it.

Kira took courage to visit Mr. Henkam and said, "I want to earn some money to go to a student exchange program in America. If Mrs. Henkam doesn't like walking the dog, can I help you?"

Her face turned red, but Mr. Henkam agreed right away. He was willing to pay Kira two marks a day, and if she could teach the dog some skills like sitting and shaking hands, he would pay her 20 marks more.

Kira was very happy and ran home to tell Money the dog. Kira earned her first money from the advice of the dog who knew about money management.

This story sounds like a fairy tale, but it tells us a real thing: chances to make money are hidden in other people's problems. The point is whether you can find problems that other people want to solve, and most importantly, whether it is something you like to do. Because things you like are definitely things you are good at. Making money from things you like will give you more energy.

When your hobbies and work are combined, people can naturally keep going without stopping, without being lazy, without giving up easily, and can be patient. That's why people say love is a strong power from the heart. When we do something from our heart, something we really like, even if we face problems, we can still enjoy the process of making money.

**Build Money Thinking: Raise Your Own Money Goose**

On the same day, Kira's aunt came to visit. Suddenly, she recognized Money. It was the dog of their neighbor next door! The real owner was Mr. Chin. Kira was sad because she had to say goodbye to Money soon.

The next day, Kira's dad took Kira and Money to visit Mr. Chin. He lived in a big house. It turned out that not long ago, when Mr. Chin was driving past Kira's house with Money, he had an accident. He was badly hurt and unconscious. When he woke up, he was in the hospital. During his time in the hospital, he kept asking people to look for his dog, but there was no news. He was very grateful that Kira's family took good care of Money. But because he needed to stay in the hospital for a long time and then stay in a nursing home for a few weeks, Mr. Chin offered to pay Kira to continue taking care of Money.

Kira was very happy to know that she could still live with Money for some time. Money the dog came back and continued to be Kira's money management teacher. This time, the dog wanted to find a way to help Kira's parents get out of debt.

Money said that Mr. Chin had a money advice company, and he often taught people how to manage their money. Money often heard him teach how to get out of debt:

First, stop using credit cards because people usually spend more when using credit cards than using cash.

Second, the monthly payment for debt should be as low as possible. Otherwise, after paying debt each month, you will have very little money left.

Third, don't wait until you are out of debt to start saving. Start saving now.

Fourth, before spending money, ask yourself if this thing is really necessary to buy.

Kira wrote down these four things in a notebook and decided to follow Money's advice and start saving now and never borrow money.

One weekend, Kira took Money to the nursing home to visit Mr. Chin. While they were talking, Mr. Chin heard Kira mention her success journal. So, Mr. Chin told her a story about a goose that laid golden eggs.

There was a farmer who raised a goose. One day, he was surprised to find that the goose laid a golden egg. He was very happy and took the egg to sell and made a lot of money. Every day, the goose laid him a golden egg. But the greedy farmer felt the goose was too slow. "Why doesn't it lay two golden eggs a day?" He got angry and cut open the goose's belly to see how many golden eggs were inside. And from then on, the farmer never got any golden eggs again.

Mr. Chin told Kira that in this story, the goose represents money. If you save money, you will get interest. The golden egg represents interest. Don't spend all your money. Save some money and let money keep making interest. Don't touch this saved money, which means don't kill your goose. Otherwise, you will not get golden eggs.

Back home, Kira counted her income recently. She earned 74 marks. Following Mr. Chin's advice, she decided to turn 50% of her income into her own goose, saving 40% of her income into two piggy banks for her dreams, and using the remaining 10% for spending.

If you can manage money in this way, you can make sure to do things you like, and then keep making more money.

But in reality, many people misunderstand saving money. "I don't have enough money to spend, how can I save?" or "I have to wait until I have a lot of money to start saving," etc. Actually, no matter how much money you earn, you will never feel enough. Because when income increases, people's wishes and spending also increase. If you don't develop a habit of managing money and saving money, you will likely never become rich.

As the writer also wrote in a famous book, "No one can become rich just by making money. Being rich depends on keeping money." So, from now on, you should plan to manage the money you earn.

The dreams mentioned here can be big or small. It can be a trip to a place you love or a camera for your hobby. We know that the joy of making dreams come true will encourage you and attract more chances to make money.

The flow of energy in the universe is always balanced. There is going in and going out, and it's the same with money. You need to know how to spend money to know how to make money. At the same time, we also need to slowly build money thinking in life. The most important thing is to be clear about what is needed and what is not needed. Then try to buy less things that are not needed and put that money into savings or other investments.

Learning to manage money will help you build a feeling of being rich and having enough. Your life will be able to handle problems and be protected by your savings.

**Use Money Wisely: Take a Step to Invest**

Mr. Henkam, Kira's neighbor, introduced Kira to a new customer, Mrs. Tao Mu, a neighbor living alone. Mrs. Tao Mu would be away for two weeks and needed someone to take care of her dogs. Because Kira couldn't take care of three dogs alone, she asked her cousin and a friend to help.

But on that day, the three kids found the door of Mrs. Tao Mu's house was broken into, so they immediately called the police. Luckily, the money and valuable things in a safe box were not noticed by the thief.

To thank the three kids for protecting her property, Mrs. Tao Mu, who knew about investing, offered to guide the three kids to start an investment club to make money together.

On the day the club was started, Mrs. Tao Mu gave the club 5,000 marks for each child and put in 5,000 herself. So, the club account had 20,000 marks in total for everyone to start investing.

She told everyone that investing is easier than most people think. You only need to pay attention to three points:

First, investing must be simple, clear, and easy to understand.

Second, money should be invested in safe places.

Third, whether money can make more golden eggs depends on choosing investments with the highest interest and profit.

And the investment with the highest profit comes from stocks.

"What are stocks?" the children asked.

Mrs. Tao Mu said, "You don't need to have your own company. Just invest in other companies. You can buy stocks of that company. Whenever the company makes a profit, the profit will be shared with everyone who holds stocks. This is called dividends. If the company's value increases, everyone's stocks will be worth more. If some people think the company will keep increasing in value, they can pay a higher price to buy your stocks. If no one buys your stocks, you will have to lower the price, which means you can also risk losing money."

Kira heard that stocks can make money but are not safe. She felt investing might not be for her. Mrs. Tao Mu agreed and said, "If you buy stocks yourself, it's true. But you can also let professionals help you choose stocks. This is a safer way to invest, called mutual funds. This way allows you to become a shareholder of companies you like, like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, etc."

"Mutual funds are like a big pot. Many investors put money into it. Because investors don't have time, professional knowledge, or interest to buy stocks themselves, they put money into this big pot for professional money managers to manage. These money managers will use the money in the mutual fund to buy stocks. Mutual funds are watched by the government, so they are very safe. The money managers must follow national rules, at least buying 20 different stocks to spread out risks from stock market changes. Because the situation of each company can become bad. For example, suppose some stocks go down, but there are still some stocks going up. Overall, you won't face too much risk of losing a lot of money. Even if most stocks go down, just wait patiently for some time, and the market will go up again."

Hearing this, the children understood and wanted to use the money to invest in mutual funds right away. Mrs. Tao Mu smiled when she saw the kids understood and continued to advise, "If you decide to buy mutual funds, you need to be mentally prepared to put money in it for at least 5 to 10 years. If you can wait longer, mutual funds are almost a risk-free way because after such a long time, most stocks will have good profits. Many successful funds have kept a stable profit of 12% for a long time. For example, if we use the club's first capital of 20,000 marks to buy mutual funds, after 20 years, our income can increase 10 times compared to when we started. If each person puts 250 marks into our initial account every month, and at a profit rate of 12%, after 20 years, the total money in our account will exceed 1 million marks."

The children cheered. This amount of money was so big, it was beyond everyone's imagination.

"But how can we know which fund to choose? There are many types of funds, right?" the children asked again.

Mrs. Tao Mu continued to show everyone how to choose the best fund:

First, the fund should have a history of over 10 years. If it has consistently made profits for a long time, it is likely to perform well in the future.

Second, we should choose large international stock funds. This type of fund buys stocks all over the world to spread out risks, so it is very safe.

Finally, we should compare the performance charts of funds, seeing which funds have had good annual profits over the past 10 years.

Under Mrs. Tao Mu's guidance, the three children chose the best fund. In the following days, the club often met and learned new investment knowledge. The children always couldn't control their curiosity and kept checking the current situation of the fund, finding that it had suddenly dropped and lost 25%. So everyone felt disappointed.

Mrs. Tao Mu then comforted them, "Only when we sell, we can have a loss. No selling, no loss." She had experienced several economic crises and knew that market instability is normal, and after a year or two, everything will recover. She also said, "Now is the winter of the stock market, a good time to buy when prices are low."

However, just when everyone was preparing to put more money into the fund, Mr. Chin immediately gave Kira advice, "Don't use more money to buy into the fund because the market may continue to fall. Always keep some cash. Don't invest all your money in stocks or funds."

Several months later, Kira's life had changed completely. On one hand, the investment club achieved great success. She made more money and could make her dream list come true. On the other hand, she started looking for new ways to increase income, working with Mr. Chin to open a company to help children learn about money and investing. Under Mr. Chin's advice, Kira's dad hired people to help with his business. Now he had more free time and could focus on things he liked and was good at, while giving work he didn't like or wasn't good at to others. From then on, his income got better, and Kira's parents no longer worried about money problems.

Kira felt very lucky and happy to receive guidance from Money the dog. Thanks to Money, she bravely stepped into the path of money investing, bringing big changes to her life. She believed that the future would be better and better.

**How to Keep the Right Attitude About Managing Money**

In the last part of the video, I will discuss with you one last thing: what attitude should we have to start managing money?

Kira finally succeeded in helping her family overcome difficulties and had a big change in her life. But looking back at the early days before following Money's advice to start managing money, she really hesitated. She didn't understand much about this method, so she just wanted to try it out. But Money said firmly, "Sometimes we don't need to fully understand why a method works. The important thing is that it works. Doubt is good, but don't let doubt stop progress."

Whether making money or working, we don't need to spend too much time finding out why the experience of those who went before is effective, as long as we know that it is useful for ourselves. In life, there are many such people. They hesitate to act because they have not figured out every detail. What they don't realize is that nothing is ever completely ready. If you delay because you are obsessed with details and doubt about the future, you will only miss the best time to complete the work.

Just like someone said, "A decision, no matter how good, cannot stand delay." Only when you start acting can you get real and most effective feedback and optimize your action plan based on that feedback.

Someone else said, "Wealth encourages people to invest time and become more patient." Once we start building awareness of money management in a planned way, be patient in doing small things and keep doing it, you will gradually enter a positive cycle of investing, being patient, making money, then investing again, being more patient, and making more money.

Life is like a boat sailing on the ocean. Real dreams are the lighthouse that guides your way. Can you focus on moving towards the lighthouse in you? At this time, a correct understanding will be the fuel to make your boat work powerfully. Distributing the money you earn reasonably is to keep the rudder stable so that the boat is not overturned. Learning to invest is like finding a chance to speed up, helping you reach your dream destination sooner.

Hopefully, all of us can improve our wishes and understanding of money, live prosperously, get rid of all money worries, so that we can achieve more freedom and happiness.
