## I. why do I study English forever but not become good?

There are several reasons why you might feel like you've been studying English for a long time but haven't become as proficient as you'd like. Language learning is a complex process and improvement isn't always linear. Here are some common factors and what you can do about them:

1. Ineffective Study Methods:

Passive Learning: You might be spending a lot of time reading textbooks or watching videos passively, but not actively engaging with the language. Passive learning includes things like rereading notes or highlighting text, which doesn't strongly reinforce memory or application.
Lack of Active Practice: Language learning requires active use. If you're not speaking, writing, and actively listening, you're not fully exercising your English skills.
Focusing Solely on Grammar Rules: While grammar is important, overemphasizing rules without practical application can hinder fluency. You might know the rules but struggle to use them in real conversations.
Using Only One Resource: Relying on a single textbook or app might not provide a well-rounded learning experience. Different resources offer different perspectives and practice types.
Solution:

Prioritize Active Learning: Focus on activities that require you to actively use English:
Speaking Practice: Find language partners, tutors, or conversation groups. Record yourself speaking and listen back to identify areas for improvement.
Writing Practice: Write journals, emails, stories, or participate in online forums in English.
Active Listening: Listen to podcasts, music, and movies actively. Don't just let them play in the background. Try to understand specific words and phrases, and then try to repeat them.
Vocabulary Building through Context: Learn new words in context (from books, movies, conversations) rather than just memorizing word lists. Use flashcards or spaced repetition systems (like Anki) to actively review vocabulary.
Diversify Your Resources: Use a variety of materials like textbooks, apps, podcasts, videos, and real-world English content. 2. Lack of Consistency and Immersion:

Sporadic Study: Studying intensely for a short period and then taking long breaks can slow down progress. Consistent, even if shorter, study sessions are more effective.
Limited Exposure: If you only study English during lessons and don't expose yourself to English outside of study time, your learning environment is limited.
Native Language Dominance: If you primarily think and communicate in your native language and only switch to English during study sessions, your brain isn't fully adapting to English.
Solution:

Establish a Regular Study Schedule: Set aside specific times each day or week to study English and stick to it as much as possible. Even 15-30 minutes of focused study daily is better than longer, infrequent sessions.
Create an Immersive Environment:
Surround yourself with English: Change your phone and computer language to English. Listen to English music and podcasts while commuting. Watch English movies and TV shows with subtitles (initially, then try without).
Think in English: Try to think in English during your daily routines. Describe your surroundings or plan your day in English in your mind.
Seek Opportunities to Use English in Real Life: Engage with English-speaking communities online or in person. Travel to English-speaking countries if possible. 3. Unrealistic Expectations and Patience:

Expecting Quick Results: Language learning takes time and dedication. It's not a sprint, but a marathon. Don't get discouraged if you don't see dramatic results immediately.
Comparing Yourself to Others: Everyone learns at their own pace. Comparing your progress to others can be demotivating. Focus on your own journey and celebrate your personal achievements.
Perfectionism: Being afraid to make mistakes can paralyze you. Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process and crucial for improvement.
Solution:

Set Realistic Goals: Focus on small, achievable goals. Instead of aiming to become fluent in a month, aim to learn 10 new words a week or have a 5-minute conversation in English.
Be Patient and Persistent: Understand that progress is gradual. Celebrate small victories and keep practicing even when you feel stuck.
Embrace Mistakes: View mistakes as learning opportunities. Don't be afraid to speak or write even if you're not perfect. Analyze your mistakes and learn from them.
Focus on Progress, Not Perfection: Concentrate on how much you've improved over time rather than aiming for flawless English immediately. 4. Lack of Clear Goals and Motivation:

Vague Goals: Simply wanting to "learn English" is too broad. Without specific goals, it's hard to measure progress and stay motivated.
Weak Motivation: If your reasons for learning English are not strong enough, you might lose interest and motivation easily.
No Feedback and Correction: Without feedback, you might be repeating mistakes without realizing it.
Solution:

Set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) Goals: For example, "I will be able to hold a basic conversation in English about my hobbies within 3 months." or "I will increase my vocabulary by 500 words in the next 2 months."
Find Your "Why": Connect your English learning to your personal interests, career aspirations, travel plans, or cultural curiosity. Having a strong personal reason will keep you motivated.
Seek Feedback:
Language Partners/Tutors: Ask for feedback on your pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.
Online Language Exchange Platforms: Many platforms offer opportunities for peer correction and feedback on writing.
Record Yourself Speaking: Listen to your recordings and identify areas where you can improve. 5. Not Addressing Specific Weaknesses:

Ignoring Problem Areas: Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses in language learning. You might be strong in grammar but weak in listening comprehension, or vice-versa. Ignoring your weaknesses will hold you back.
Not Identifying Specific Needs: Your English learning needs might be different depending on your goals (e.g., business English, conversational English, academic English).
Solution:

Identify Your Weaknesses: Reflect on your learning process. Where do you struggle the most? Is it speaking fluency, listening comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation?
Targeted Practice: Focus your study efforts on your identified weaknesses. If you struggle with listening, spend more time listening to English content. If vocabulary is a challenge, dedicate more time to vocabulary building activities.
Tailor Your Learning to Your Goals: If you need English for work, focus on business English vocabulary and communication skills. If you want to travel, prioritize conversational English and practical phrases.
In summary, becoming proficient in English is a journey that requires the right methods, consistent effort, patience, and a positive mindset. By addressing the potential issues outlined above and actively implementing the suggested solutions, you can significantly improve your English learning experience and achieve your goals. Don't give up, and keep practicing!

## II. Do you need talent to learn English or a foreign language?

Whether you need "talent" to learn English or any foreign language is a really interesting question and one that many language learners ask themselves! The short answer is no, you don't need a special "talent" to become proficient in a language. While some people might seem to pick up languages faster than others, language learning is more about effective strategies, consistent effort, and the right mindset than some innate, magical "language gene."

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

What people often perceive as "talent" is usually something else:

Early Exposure: Children who grow up in multilingual environments or start learning languages very young often appear more "talented." However, this is largely due to their brains being more adaptable at a younger age and having more years of exposure, not necessarily innate talent. Adults can absolutely become fluent, it might just take different strategies and potentially more time.
Strong Motivation and Interest: People who are deeply interested in a language or culture are naturally more motivated to learn. This intrinsic motivation drives them to study more consistently, seek out opportunities to practice, and persevere through challenges. This passion can be mistaken for "talent" because they progress more quickly due to their dedication.
Effective Learning Strategies (Often Learned or Developed Early): Some people, even unknowingly, employ more effective learning techniques. This could be:
Active learning: Engaging in speaking, writing, and active listening rather than just passive study.
Immersion (even if self-created): Surrounding themselves with the language through music, movies, books, etc.
Focus on communication: Prioritizing understanding and being understood over perfect grammar from the start.
Willingness to make mistakes: Not being afraid to speak and practice even when they make errors, seeing mistakes as learning opportunities.
Good memory and learning habits: Some people might have naturally better memory or study habits in general, which helps with vocabulary and grammar. These habits are often developed, not innate "talent."
Musical Aptitude: There is some research suggesting a correlation between musical ability and phonetic awareness in language learning. Musicians may have an easier time with pronunciation and picking up the sounds of a new language. However, this is just one factor, and many successful language learners are not musically inclined.
Personality and Confidence: Extroverted and confident individuals may be more likely to practice speaking early and often, even with imperfect language skills. This practice accelerates their learning and can make them appear "talented" compared to someone who is more hesitant to speak.
Why "Talent" is not the key, and what is important:

Effort and Consistency are Paramount: Just like with any skill (playing a musical instrument, sports, etc.), consistent practice and dedicated effort are the most significant factors in language learning success. Regular, even short, study sessions are much more effective than sporadic bursts of intense study.
Effective Learning Methods (as discussed earlier): Using active learning techniques, diversifying resources, and focusing on your weaknesses will accelerate your progress much more than relying on some imagined "talent."
Positive Mindset and Perseverance: Language learning can be challenging and frustrating at times. Having a positive attitude, being patient with yourself, and persevering through difficulties is crucial. Believing you can learn a language is half the battle.
Motivation and Clear Goals: Knowing why you want to learn English (for career, travel, personal enrichment, etc.) and setting specific, achievable goals will keep you motivated and focused.
Access to Resources and Opportunities: Having access to good learning materials, teachers, language partners, and opportunities to practice the language in real-world situations definitely makes the learning process easier and more effective.
Analogy: Think about learning to play the piano. Some people might seem to "naturally" pick it up faster initially. Maybe they have a good ear for music, or good hand-eye coordination. But ultimately, to become a skilled pianist, everyone needs to put in hours of practice, learn techniques, and persevere through challenges. Language learning is very similar.

In conclusion, don't get discouraged if you feel like you "lack talent." Focus on what you can control:

Develop effective learning strategies.
Study consistently and make it a habit.
Stay motivated and focused on your goals.
Be patient and persistent.
Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities.
With the right approach and dedication, anyone can learn English or any foreign language to a high level of proficiency, regardless of whether they believe they have "talent." It's about the journey, the effort, and enjoying the process!

English becomes a valuable asset for career advancement, even if the company isn't strictly "international."
Specialized Roles and Higher Expertise: Many highly specialized and lucrative fields (like international law, finance, global marketing, international technology consulting, scientific research, etc.) often require a very high level of English proficiency. These fields tend to offer higher compensation due to their specialized nature and global reach.
Becoming a "Bridge" for Opportunities: In many workplaces, people who speak English can act as a bridge between local teams and international partners, clients, or teams.
