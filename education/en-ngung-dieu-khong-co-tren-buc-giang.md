The professor's father said that learning is the shortest path to escape poverty. At that time, was learning really the only way? Learning isn't just about going to school, it's not just about having a degree. Learning here has many meanings. At the time my father said that to me, it was because I was in love, chasing girls, neglecting my studies, and he wanted to advise me. He said I had to work hard, I used that as an excuse, so my father said that learning was the quickest way to escape poverty. "If you're poor, you'll have to be a hired hand, so don't drop out of school, son." That saying was true for a few years, true until I got my PhD and started postdoctoral research. When I got my first tenure-track position, it was true that learning helped me escape poverty. But the interesting thing is, the further I went, the more I felt that escaping poverty was just an initial effect. The effects of learning are far beyond material things. For example, when I wanted to get into university from high school, I believed my father and went to university. But when I got to university, I saw opportunities open up to pursue graduate studies. In high school, I didn't know what graduate studies were, what scientific research was. I didn't even imagine what researchers and scientists did. But when I got to university, I understood, and then I pursued graduate studies. And when I was in graduate school, I learned what university professors do, what they research, and how they do research. Then I had a dream, because everyone has dreams, but our dreams are limited by our knowledge and experiences. For example, if you ask a young person in a mountainous Hmong village what their dream is, they might say "a piece of land and two buffaloes" because their life is limited to the village, and a piece of land and two buffaloes is enough. Just like me, from high school my dream was just to go to university. But when I got to university, it expanded my horizons to graduate school. In graduate school, it opened up another horizon. The higher I study, the further I see. And the further I see, the bigger my dreams become. And the more experiences I have, the further my dreams reach. And once your dream becomes so far, surpassing your personal limits, then you will realize that the value of learning is not limited to yourself anymore, and it's no longer limited to how much salary I get, what benefits I have, what title I achieve. When learning reaches that level, you will question what value my knowledge brings to this society. Have you ever thought about why you live, why you exist here? The answer is, why don't you ask what your value is to your existence in this society? Learning helps you realize all those values. But from what you've shared so far, teacher, you've touched upon many points of intellectual engagement. I wonder how you learn, how you read, what your habits are for absorbing knowledge?

Ah, truly, the first thing that comes to mind is still the process I remember from wandering in bookstores in the US, in my first year there. I wandered into a bookstore and found a SparkNote summary on Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, that is, levels of thinking according to Bloom. And I was like, "Ah, it's like..." Luckily, I wasn't in the shower, or I would have run out naked into the street, but it was almost like that! "This is the path, this is my path!" I immediately grabbed it, analyzed it, and studied it according to that. It's like there are levels of thinking: first, remembering, then understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and at the top, creating, with some variations now. The model might place application and creation at the top level, or maybe just creation at the very top. But that was an initial step in my learning. And like that, it must be a rather deep method. It's like everything I do, I must analyze and evaluate to integrate it, to incorporate it into my brain or into my store of existing knowledge. It's like this: if you just learn by throwing things into your head like throwing trash, it won't have any value. This is based on the concept and imagery of Baddeley in cognitive psychology, meaning that when short-term memory or working memory is active, you must draw upon memories, that is, memories of previously related events, and you analyze them and put them together to form a unified whole. Only then does it become your knowledge. If you don't process it that way – deep learning style – you can store things in your brain’s warehouse, but they become completely separate, disparate chunks. Then it's still just data, not yet worthy of being called knowledge. A person's knowledge must lie in that synthesis. Not to mention something extremely important: with that synthesis, you can then unify. You can talk about feminism, you can talk about parenting, you can talk about counseling, you can talk about achieving goals, and they become a unified whole. Otherwise, you're just talking about them as disparate things.

That's one way of learning. The second way is that you have to draw out memories, dissect this and that, and so on, to make it become a unified whole. That's the second way. And the third way is, you must learn to let your mind wander a bit, daydream a little. The learning I just talked about is all using algorithms and conscious learning. But the third way is learning by the unconscious. Truly, when you do anything to relax your mind, when you do anything, usually those are uncomplicated actions that don't require high focus. You can just do them and let your mind think. For those who don't experience internal conflicts, that default state is when ideas combine in a very random way. You see, those are three ways of learning. Initially, Bloom's Taxonomy, second, the method of integrating into, what's called deep learning, and third, letting the subconscious work. I'll throw in a bonus part called "DiLR." Every time I go to learn, and I still learn regularly, learn anything, I don't just... First, I create a framework, which I also want to help young people out there learn better. A framework, that is, an outline, a structure based on the book. The outline is just the subtitles and sub-subtitles, that is, headings and subheadings. Then, when I start taking notes, if the teacher says something that I write as "L", meaning it’s not in the book, only the teacher said it, then I note it with "L," meaning "lecture." Then, when I ponder it, I mark that part with "R," meaning "reflection." If there’s a word or concept I don't understand, I write down the question, and I mark it with "I" – short "i," that is, "inquiry." Then, if while listening, it suddenly occurs to me, "Oh, this can be applied here and there," I mark that with "A" – "application." So, my notes are just “L,” “I,” “R,” and “A.” It spells "LiRA." It's not like everything we hear has all four components, sometimes it’s just this or that, and if it has all four, that’s great. That's extremely useful. Later, if you write books or rewrite notes, you won’t plagiarize the teacher's ideas, because the reflection and application parts are your own. You can then write freely, and you don't need to rewrite sentences from the book. That’s already in the text. Here you only need to write down "L," the lecture parts – what the teacher said. But this requires you to listen attentively and to have skimmed through the book beforehand. That's part of deep learning. It's not just about doing it yourself, but even when listening to a lecture, you are interacting. And to do that, your short-term memory, working memory, must be really strong, really broad so it can hold information, because it’s both listening and thinking, and they are layered on top of each other. So, with teachers who speak very fast, very concisely, it’s extremely difficult. But teachers who explain at length and give examples, they provide time for you to do the "LiRA" process. That's how it is.

I wonder, at a broader level, for more people, and not just within a classroom, within an event – what makes people change from simply performing to, “Ah, I'm changing?” Here, it’s not just about the issue of someone's performance, but if we talk more deeply about change, where does change begin for a person? Generally, there’s a common principle, regardless of whether the person is old or young, their occupation, industry, or region – it starts with the person's own desire. If everything doesn’t start from a person's own desire, then it won't get into their head. For example, the young person I mentioned earlier – because they must start from their desire, their only desire is to earn more money. Other things they don't care about. So, just talk about money, talk about making money. Why keep talking about things not related to money, everyday talking about ideology and philosophy which have nothing to do with money? They won’t care. But conversely, how to make money? In making money, there's ideology, there's philosophy, there's ethics, there are many other things. Then the person will receive it very warmly, whoever they are, whether old or young. Just start from the desire of the person themselves, and perhaps in education, this is very important, and in any industry, too. For example, you can talk about their concerns, their desires. Starting from a person's own desires, everything will be received. So, I understand the diagram you often draw. This diagram is quite crucial in your book, isn’t it?

This diagram is just part of the story, like, how to operate your life, in a way that you like. For example, everyone often says “Be yourself.” But is “being yourself” good, or is doing so losing yourself? So, is there really “being yourself” or “losing yourself”? There are two things that perhaps not just young people, but people of all ages talk about: “Be yourself,” and “Love yourself.” Those are very common phrases, very familiar. But if you understand these two things well, and these two things that are now very popular, very familiar, they are incredibly meaningful, incredibly beautiful. “Be yourself,” “Love yourself.” Just understand those two phrases, and your life will already be different, your daily life will be different. "Life" sounds too grand, but your daily “life” has already changed. This model is just like, how to explain “Be yourself.” Because to “be yourself,” you first must “have yourself.” Do you think in all these years, anyone has been able to find the law of life, someone like you? Probably not, right? No, probably not. Why? Because thinking about the operation of the universe, notice that no two days are ever the same. Some days, before you wake up, the sun is already bright. Some days, it's almost noon, and the sky is still gloomy. From that, I think the discovery is: instability is the essence of life. There is a Chinese saying: “Everything in the world changes, the only thing that never changes is change itself.” If you're surprised by change, if you panic about unexpected things, then you don't understand the law. Peace of mind only comes when you feel, “Oh, even a storm is just part of the law, what’s there to worry about?” Stay calm, stay composed, like Master Tổ Sư said to each other, “Be calm, find a solution.” That's how you get out of it. Panicking doesn't solve anything. But why panic? The biggest panic that we can't fix is: why are we here? And the second biggest panic we can't fix is: when will we leave, leave how, leave where, when? Those are the two biggest things we can't solve. So, for other things, whatever you encounter, just solve it. That's it, isn't it profound? One of your favorite sayings in this program is, “Actually, all these conversations are aimed at just that purpose: ‘Who am I, and what am I here on Earth to do?’” You know, I learned this question when I was how old? 14 years old. I was obsessed with reading books, reading all kinds of books, including boring ones, but at that time it was a compulsion, a necessity to learn, because I encountered a strange shock. When I was six years old, I talked with my mother around 7 PM. Then at 10 PM, my mother died in a traffic accident, taken to the hospital. We rushed to the hospital, and right at that moment, about an hour and a half before she passed away. I looked, looked, and thought, "What kind of life is this?" Just a moment ago, we were talking, just a moment ago, this, just a moment ago that. Why suddenly, silently, without saying anything anymore? That was the first shock. The second shock was, we children stood there, watching the adults carry my mother down, put her there, then told us to put a handful of soil down, then they put a handful of soil down, then went home. I was so angry, but I didn't know who to fight with. "What is this? Is this all there is to a person’s life?” I couldn’t accept it. I didn't want to live anymore. But how to die? When I think about it now, how awful my thinking was. So I started searching, searching, searching, searching to ask, "Why did this happen?" And I found two soulmates, two wise men, whose questions were, “Who am I? What am I here to do?” Why didn't anyone ask me if I wanted to come here or not? And once I’m here, where do I go? Reading and reading, I gradually realized that these are questions of humanity, and no one can answer them. Sometimes religion, Buddhism, Catholicism, can give you some peace of mind, but a real answer? Does it even exist? It’s impossible. And you know, when you're like that, you're no longer normal anymore. If you're just stubborn, people can still see it, people can still help you, someone might give you a crutch. But that split, that trauma, that accident, it's inside your brain, so no one can help you except yourself. And from then on, I thought, "Encounter this, learn about it, see what happens. Encounter that, learn about it, see what happens." Because without mother, without father, you have to solve it yourself. I wish I could talk to them all.

Meaning, now we have a pill, or a chip, could we put it in a very young, very similar version of ourselves? Is there anything in that? Actually, from childhood to adulthood, I’ve always been able to do this: you have to take ownership, you have to be responsible for your own journey. And this spirit of responsibility, I really like it, my father taught me. He didn't say it, but he did it. The generation of my parents, and I think our parents, we all agree that their work ethic was extremely strong, their responsibility was incredible. They probably didn’t even like what they were doing, but they were extremely responsible. And he was responsible in every role of his life: as a father, as a husband, as a worker. I really love my father very much. And the spirit that I learned from him from childhood until now is: I must be responsible for myself, for all my actions and choices. That's it. As long as I'm responsible, then whether I'm wrong or right, whatever happens, it's okay because I'm responsible. So, when I meet young people, whether they are similar to me or not, in our conversations, usually we don’t advise, but we guide them to have all the information, then, "Dear, you make whatever decision that brings you peace of mind first, okay? Because if your career decision doesn't bring you peace of mind, even if it seems right in everyone's eyes, it's still not good, because it will affect your mental health." But if they ask for advice, if they ask, "Phoenix, do you have any advice for me?", I will tell them, "You should never deny yourself. And if you can take responsibility for everything you do, if you dare to take responsibility, then just do it."

As a writer, you can observe that young people's attention span might be shorter, simply, even biologically, now everyone sees that phones make our attention spans shorter and shorter. Do you have any slight concern about young people reading your work? You must view young people in a... not too extreme way, and don't worry about whether young people read superficially or this or that. First, I want to tell you, I really believe in young people. When you receive something, it only needs to leave a slight impression. I’m telling you, your parents taught you so much, but do you remember everything? You only remember a few sentences that might change your life. Or you encounter someone, they talk a lot, for example, I'm talking. You won’t remember everything. But surely you will remember a few ideas, and those ideas might have an impact. So, young people are reading. Now the amount of information is too much, why force them to be attentive? But they are reading, and that's already precious. And when they read, they may receive it from their own perspective, "This part is good," they remember one detail. And that is selection. Just like the food we put into our body, not everything can be digested, but it only needs a few nutrients, B12, B6, whatever, that’s enough to make us healthy. So, with literature, as a writer, you must try to bring the best things to the reader, and how the reader receives it, even if they only receive a little bit, it's still very precious. And especially young people. We often complain that young people are not as good as previous generations, but I ask you, why is the world developing more and more? Then young people must be more capable. Maybe they are not as good as us in some aspects, for example, resilience, because they are pampered. Or, for example, stories about philosophy or whatever, but for information, there are many ways to access it, not necessarily just reading books. But still, I believe that one day books will be irreplaceable. Even AI cannot replace books, cannot replace writers. Why are people in the West now, when you go out, you see them carrying books? It's not that they're not developed, but they once had a period like us, meaning a period when visual culture developed, at that time they also rushed into visual culture. Until it reached saturation, they returned to books. And we will also reach that stage. And currently, we are in a developing stage. I met a Japanese friend, a Japanese in Vietnam, and he said, "Vietnam today is like Japan in the 1960s," meaning in a few decades, Japan became what it is today. And in a few decades, our country will become what it is today. And all the future belongs to whom? To young people. Young people will know how to select the information they receive. And at a certain stage, let me put it simply, at 18 years old, many young men are in love, very confused, not knowing which girl to choose. But by 21, you will know how to choose someone. Everything reaches a stage, it must be refined over time. And young people will have their ways.

I think being a good student in class also helps you try hard. Learning, but there comes a point when you can't turn back and say, "Oh, back then everyone forced me to become a good student, now my pressure is to be successful." So, where do you stand in the boundary between the fact that some standards and benchmarks help people try hard, some role models also help people try hard, but after that, what point lets people know, "Ah, I'm strong enough to try my best, but I'm not chasing values that may not be truly for me, truly correct?” Right, how can those hardships make themselves valuable, making us realize what is… that is, ourselves, being refined, trained? Fire tests gold, hardship tests strength. And through hardships, sometimes we realize what is… this is my limit. The problem here is, when Ms. Bảo Minh says, "Minh, jump for me at a height of about 1.8m, 1.9m, 2m," then Minh can do it, right? But if you say, "Jump for me around 3m," then probably not. However, in neuroscience, there's a method called "small wins." Meaning, if we say, "Minh, meditation is great, tomorrow, practice meditation for half an hour." If you say, "Tomorrow I'll meditate for a full half hour," if you immediately start meditating for half an hour, you will fail. If you immediately start exercising for an hour every day, you will fail, because it exceeds your body's endurance and your mental endurance. Instead, change, effort, should be more scientifically based on "small wins," meaning, small, little by little. Like, once in a training with students, I said, "If now you want to practice meditation, how should we start?" Someone said 5 minutes, someone said 15 minutes. I said, "Even smaller, what’s even smaller?" 1 minute. I asked, "No, what's even smaller than 1 minute?" Breath, exactly. One breath. If we can just stop and start with one breath, just one breath, not thinking about anything else, just focusing on breathing in and breathing out, you've already succeeded. Change, progress, effort, striving, we must always focus on making it as small as possible, as small as possible to the point that we can do it, and if we don't do it, we should feel very ashamed, "Oh, it's so small, and I can't even do it." It must be so small that you make it a habit. Like meditation, start from one breath. Like exercise, start from just standing up and sitting down, one movement, or sometimes just 30 seconds or 1 minute. Like when you want to read a book, you start with just a paragraph or a page. Anything small, little by little, will become something big, just like the 'small wins’ I just mentioned. I think that’s what keeps us from being overwhelmed, “Oh, that's too high." Because now when we look up, it seems too high, but if we just go step by step, little by little, there’s a very good image that sometimes I share with people: two people standing before two ladders, one ladder has small steps, so you can climb up step by step, and one ladder has steps this far apart, how can you reach up? You’ll just give up. I think that's the way to view misfortunes, to view successes, to view those benchmarks, to see if it’s too far or too high, too close or too low, to see where the key is. The point is how we approach it, what our plan is.
