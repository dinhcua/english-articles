**Radio Kết Nối: Unlock Your Super Memory**

When I was born, I didn't have any special talents. My memory skills are all from practice since I was little. Most of us, until the end of our lives, only use about 10 percent of our memory ability. To remember things for a long time, my advice is for everyone to appreciate life. Be enthusiastic about everything in life, and you will remember everything better.

The saying you just heard is from Alan, the author of the book "The Secret of a Super Memory." He also holds a Guinness record for remembering a long number after hearing it just once. Yes, just once! Isn't it amazing? Throughout his book, he uses real examples and facts to help us understand that most people lack confidence in their memory. They think their memory is weak and can't be improved. But in reality, your ability is much more amazing than you think.

Through memory exercises that he used on himself, and shared throughout the book, he proves that most people can do what he does, or even better. Today, Radio Kết Nối will explore with you why we often forget. We will explain people's mindsets, common wrong ideas, and false beliefs about memory. Then, we'll share specific exercises to help you remember in many everyday situations. This includes remembering names, phone numbers, vocabulary, shopping lists, tasks, and remembering for presentations, studying, and exams.

One common method is the special association method. This method was used by ancient Romans thousands of years ago. It’s a pretty interesting and unique method. It turns boring things we have to remember into strange and attractive images, making them easier to remember. I believe that anyone who wants to improve their memory, no matter their age, can use these methods and exercises from this book. If you're still unsure, let's start!

**Part 1: Wrong Ideas About Memory and Surprising Facts**

How many times have you had to look for your keys because you couldn't remember where you put them? This makes you late and annoyed. Or, you accidentally meet someone you know but can't remember their name, making you feel embarrassed. You tell yourself, "My brain is terrible!" You might think you have a "goldfish memory." But do you know that this idea is wrong? Let me tell you something surprising:

**Surprise 1: You Can Have a Good Memory and Still Be Forgetful**

Memory isn't one complete system. Just because you find it hard to remember names and faces, it doesn't mean your whole memory system is bad. They might not even be connected! Actually, you might have a good memory in some areas but a poor memory in others. What we need to do is improve the areas where our memory is weaker.

**Surprise 2: Your Memory Isn't as Bad as You Think**

We often misunderstand and underestimate our memory. There are two main reasons for this:

- **Small failures stand out more than many successes:** For example, studies show we use our keys 14 times a month. Let’s say we forget our keys only once that month. So, in reality, we remembered where our keys were 140 times that month. That means we succeed 95% of the time. But with just that 5% failure, we wrongly think our memory is very bad.

- **We focus on failures, not successes:** Think about remembering names. Each month we might meet hundreds of people and remember their names and things about them. But if in one month we meet five people and can’t remember their names, we quickly decide it’s because of a bad memory. Then we become negative, convince ourselves our memory is bad, and stop trying to remember.

**Another Surprise: Age is Just an Excuse**

Our memory can get worse because of age-related physical reasons, but that's not the only cause for every memory problem. Many people use age as an excuse. There’s no real limit to how much a person can remember. There are theoretical limits, but we'll never reach them. Over 90 percent of our brain is not used. The things we remember in our lifetime only fill up about 10 percent of our memory. Every day, we remember hundreds and thousands of new things. Think about this with the years we live – it's hard to imagine how big that number is! And it only fills up one-tenth of our memory. This shows your memory ability is much better than you think.

The first thing stopping you from improving your memory is not believing in yourself. From this moment on, I hope you will stop saying things like "My memory is so bad," or "My memory isn't as good as it used to be." Start fresh and believe in your memory. If you want to see the next part of this video, you need to be ready to change. I can’t help you if you're not ready to change.

**Part 2: Getting Ready to Improve Your Memory**

Now, let’s look at some reasons that might affect your memory. Understanding these can help you get ready to train your memory.

**1. Real Desire**

Alan Katz was hired to teach memory to an older woman. She did all the exercises he gave her – locked the door, took her medicine, went to the doctor on time, and managed her household. But, strangely, a week later, when he met her on the street, she didn’t recognize him. In this case, the woman didn't really want to improve her memory; she just wanted someone to talk to and feel better. Because of this, the memory exercises didn't work. As said before, you need to truly believe in your memory and really want to improve it for any training to work well.

**2. Change How You See Your Weak Areas**

When you meet a friend and can't remember their name, it’s embarrassing. But what about the opposite? What if someone can’t remember you, but you immediately remember them, and even remind them how you met? And they praise you, "Wow, your memory is amazing! You still remember!" Have you felt that before? It gives you confidence in your memory in that area. This is the motivation to improve your memory more.

We all have a memory "bell." It rings when you face things you think you have a great memory for. It stays silent for things you think you can't remember. For example, if you have a great memory for music, the bell rings when you hear a new song. This makes you focus more and remember it easily. But if someone invites you to a birthday party on Thursday, the bell might stay silent because you think you'll never remember someone else's birthday.

Your memory ability is based on your own view of yourself, and it can be changed. We should keep believing in our memory for areas we feel confident in, and change our view of areas where we think our memory is weak.

**3. Break Down Limits You Set for Yourself**

We all know fleas can jump really high. They can jump hundreds of times their own body length. People created a game to trick them. They put fleas in a jar with a lid. At first, the fleas jumped to escape, hitting the lid each time. Slowly, they felt the barrier and believed they couldn’t jump higher. Then, they always jumped lower than the lid, even when the lid was removed! They still didn't jump out.

This is like us. At some point in life, you set a limit for yourself. You believe your memory ability has a limit or is used up. After facing problems remembering something in a situation…

In a small town in America, an old woman was known for her amazing memory. She could exactly remember how much everyone owed her store. But this memory ability came from a very normal person. It only developed after her husband passed away. She was a widow and had no one to rely on. After her husband died, all the pressure of running the store fell on her. At this point, she had no choice but to develop her memory to break through her limits. For a normal person, it was hard. Again, remember that you absolutely can have a good memory. All the weaknesses before are just barriers we set up ourselves. And you can break them down, like that old lady.

**4. Focus and Attention**

Up to 95% of people asked can’t accurately describe the logos of big companies, even though they see them thousands of times. This is simply because most people don't really pay attention to them. The main problem with memory is lack of focus. We see things but don’t observe them. We hear things but don’t listen. This is common with magicians. They distract the audience with small details while doing tricks that the audience doesn't notice.

We say "I forgot" so many times when we haven't even tried to remember. We haven't really paid attention. That's why we struggle to find our keys. We put them down without thinking. When we meet someone and are told their name, we don't pay attention, so we forget their name.

The memory process has three steps: 1) Get information, 2) Process and remember information, 3) Recall information. At a party, you are introduced to a guy named Walter House. He writes books about raising cats. We only focus on the cat story and forget the name Walter House. The first step, getting information, failed. We often skip this step. Pay attention to the moment you are introduced and the name. You must make yourself aware of the need to remember. Effective information getting is about focused attention. Then, we save it to remember. We need to force ourselves to realize this is important. Try small exercises to increase your focus. For example, focus on reading a book or watching a video in a crowded coffee shop. When walking outside, try to pick out sounds from conversations, radios, or birds singing in the noise of traffic. At a concert, listen to the sound of each instrument.

**Part 3: Super Memory Secrets**

In this part, I'll give you methods to improve your memory. I hope you really focus so we can start training together.

**Association and Memory Are Connected**

Earlier, I talked about focused attention. So, when do we pay attention? The answer is: when it's linked to something similar. For example, the heavy shape of a hippo made a boy named Danny think of his overweight mother. If you happen to meet a man with a small black mustache, you might think of Charlie Chaplin. Association controls our memory. Everything we remember is linked to something else. Association can be in any form and use all senses.

- **Hearing:** A song reminds you of a sports championship. A soft song reminds you of past memories.
- **Smell:** The smell of autumn rain reminds you of your first days of school. The scent of lilac reminds you of a spring walk.
- **Sight:** A company paid millions for Tiger Woods to advertise their product. The goal is for everyone worldwide to remember this brand when they watch Tiger Woods play.

**3 Memory Methods Are About Creating and Practicing Associations**

We can link two completely unrelated things, even without any similarity.

**Basic Association Method (Ancient Method)**

Ancient people knew that a working memory needs two things: association and imagination. For things you want to remember, you must link them to things you already know, and you must imagine that link.

**Example: Remembering a List of Objects**

Let's try remembering a list of 10 objects: bed, fish, flower pot, watermelon, candle, frying pan, orange, car, dog, dress. Try to remember as many as you can.

Okay, I bet most of you can only remember maybe 50% of the objects, because they don't have anything to do with each other. Now, really focus on my words and get ready to imagine. We'll use our imagination to create really strange associations. Are you ready? Let's start!

- **Bed – Fish:** Imagine a smelly fish sleeping on your beloved bed. It’s really stinky and terrible!
- **Fish – Flower Pot:** The fish is stuck in a flower pot, head down, tail wiggling. Its body is jumping around and knocking against the flower pot.
- **Flower Pot – Watermelon:** Our flower pots are watermelon-shaped with bright green and white stripes.
- **Watermelon – Candle:** The watermelon has become a giant candle, with a burning flame on top.
- **Candle – Frying Pan:** The candle is used to fry eggs. We take the frying pan and put it on top of the candle to fry eggs.
- **Frying Pan – Orange:** Using the same frying pan, we use it as a tennis racket, hitting an orange away.
- **Orange – Car:** A car over there has four wheels that are giant oranges.
- **Car – Dog:** A dog is driving the car with a funny face.
- **Dog – Dress:** The dog who drives the car knows how to wear a dress and is walking happily down the street.

Okay, these are the imagined images. We’ll link them into a story. Now, try to remember these images.

- On your beloved bed, there is a huge, smelly, wet fish sleeping.
- This fish is stuck in a watermelon-shaped flower pot.
- But the watermelon is actually a candle. You see people using it to heat a frying pan and fry eggs.
- The frying pan is also used to hit a tennis ball that is an orange.
- Across the road, you see a car with wheels made of giant oranges.
- Someone is driving the car – it's a dog! The car stops, and the dog steps out wearing a pink dress.

Okay, now you can pause this video and think about the story in your head. Then, try to name the objects I listed using the story I just told you. I believe you can list over 80%, or even 100% of the objects! It’s pretty easy, right? Are you surprised? People tend to remember strange and illogical things better. A logical picture doesn't make us pay attention, so we don't keep it in memory. If you think this method is strange, believe me, I used to think so too. But try practicing a few times, and I'm sure it’s effective. Practice it regularly every day with things around you.

Here are some rules to help you create strong and effective associations:

1. **Imagine things out of proportion:** Too big, too small, illogical. For example, the giant fish I mentioned.
2. **Imagine them in action:** Moving, changing, active, like the car speeding with orange wheels.
3. **Connect between two objects:** Flower pot shaped like a watermelon.
4. **Exaggerate quantity:** Hundreds of oranges scattered everywhere.
5. **Use all senses:** Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. Imagine strange and funny images as much as possible.

**5. Memory with Excitement**

We always remember things we are excited about better. Really, there is no such thing as a generally bad memory. It’s just that we can't remember boring things. For things we are interested in, our memory is great. A woman always complained about her failing memory but remembered exactly what dress she wore to a party three years ago, especially if another woman wore the same dress yesterday. Some people complain they remember stories from 30 years ago clearly but forget what they did yesterday.

When we are young, everything is new and interesting. As we grow up, we see, hear, and know everything, so things are no longer new. To avoid forgetfulness and live a better life, we need to live enthusiastically. Once something is familiar to you, you pay more attention to it. The more attention you pay, the more you understand it.

If you have to study the principles of car engine design, and it’s boring and you can’t learn it, think about if there is any part of cars you like, like car racing. If it’s car racing, you might read about the mechanical differences between racing cars and normal cars. You'll find it interesting, and when you reread the chapter about car structure that you found terrible before, you'll find it much more interesting.

You should think about the possibility that one day you could create your own perfume. That's how you find benefits in learning this subject. To learn things you don’t like, the best way is to attack it from two sides. Learn from parts you like first, then learn the required parts. Or, try to find benefits in learning things you don't like.

So, what do you do when you face a situation where no matter how you look at it, you still don’t find it interesting, but still have to learn it? This is when you have to create fake interest. For example, to graduate, you have to take a course on the changes in attitude of King Louis the 168th to Queen Bao the 29th when she refused to let King Sleep the 19th plant tulips in the palace in the summer of 1684. You find it illogical and boring. The only way to bear it is to promise to reward yourself with a really relaxing Sunday after finishing that lecture. That’s a fake benefit you create to push yourself to learn and remember things you're not interested in. Having a reward will give you more motivation.

**6. Roman Room: Memory by Linking Old and New**

Our memory has two types:

- **Short-term memory:** Works in the outer part of the brain. Helps us process new information and temporarily save it for a short time, to use in a few minutes, hours, or days. Then we forget it. For example, you remember someone reading a phone number to order flowers. After dialing, your brain starts to forget, and the next day you can’t dial that number again.
- **Long-term memory:** Information is saved in memory and lasts a long time. It’s hard to forget, and we can recall it anytime. For example, we can't try to forget our own name or where you were born and grew up.

The Roman Room method is about taking new information we want to remember and linking it to information we can't forget. It’s about creating strong associations. Now, let’s practice this method using an example of remembering a to-do list.

**Step 1:** Plan for tomorrow by writing a list of things you want to remember to do. For example, tomorrow you need to:

1. Return the DVD movie you rented.
2. Return 50 dollars you borrowed from Xiaoran.
3. Prepare a business report.
4. Go to the post office to pay a parking ticket.
5. Buy 20 name tags for Monica's birthday.
6. Remember to send flowers.

**Step 2:** We will "hang" these tasks on objects in our house. Your house is the most familiar place. Everything in it is well-known to you and saved in your long-term memory. We should also divide rooms in our house for different types of tasks to remember. For example, the kitchen will be for tomorrow’s to-do list. The living room will be for phone calls you have to make.

We already have "memory rooms" in our minds. Here’s how we link things:

1. **Picture the objects in your house very clearly.** With each detail, color, and feature to tell them apart.
2. **Link two images in a funny, strange, and unusual way.**

Here we already have a list of objects in the kitchen in a fixed order: fridge, sink, microwave, oven, dining table. Now, we start associating to create links. Really focus and imagine with me:

- **Object 1: Fridge and Return DVD Movie:** Imagine you see dozens of DVDs in the fridge, in different genres, clearly labeled: sci-fi, drama, action, etc.
- **Object 2: Sink and Return $50 to Xiaoran:** Imagine Xiaoran standing by the sink, happily washing a 50 dollar bill.
- **Object 3: Microwave and Prepare Business Report:** What if you had a magic microwave that can turn blank paper into a report? You open the microwave, put blank paper in, set the timer for 5 minutes, and you get a detailed business report.
- **Object 4: Oven and Go to Post Office to Pay Parking Ticket and Buy Name Tags:** You can't forget to pay a parking ticket if it’s a giant ticket placed next to the oven. What about 20 name tags? We are heating them in the oven until they become soft and ready to serve to customers.
- **Object 5: Table and Send Flowers for Monica’s Birthday:** The table in the kitchen suddenly turns into a giant tree. In the middle of the tree, there is a big birthday card with the words “Happy Birthday Monica.”

Okay, remembering things to do tomorrow is easier now, right? First, clearly picture familiar objects in your room. Then, use strange and exaggerated images you imagined to recall the information you saved. Remember, the stranger and more illogical the imagined links, the easier they are to remember. If the link is too ordinary, we won't remember it.

**7. Four Keys to Remembering by Reminding Your Mind**

**Where Are My Keys?**

How many times have you been annoyed because you can’t remember where you put your keys or glasses, when you were holding them just minutes ago? There are only two ways to never forget where you put them:

- **Way 1: Be aware of your actions.** When you put your keys down on the sofa, take a second to remind yourself you put them here, on the red sofa in the middle of the living room. This focus will make your brain remember that information. Most of your forgetfulness in this case is because you lack focus.
- **Way 2: Make it a habit to always put things in a specific place.** For example, keys always hang on a hook on the wall, TV remote always under the cabinet, wallet always on the bedside table. By setting fixed places, habit of going to the right place will help you find the first place to look when you need them, and you won't forget again. This is a very good habit to develop.

**Did I Lock the Door?**

Have you ever gone shopping or to work and worried, "Did I lock the door or turn off the oven?" This makes you restless until you go back and check. There’s a simple way to solve this. Every time you leave home, when you lock the door, jiggle the key a few times to make sure it’s locked. Tell yourself, "I locked the door. I know I locked it." Make sure the oven is off and tell yourself that. You will remember that you checked. Even just saying it to yourself will remove worry.

**Remembering What We Forget**

If you can't find your keys because of a moment of forgetfulness and didn't remind yourself where you put them, use step-by-step recall of recent events. Linking events will help you slowly remember. Think back to what you planned to do when you entered the house. Did you plan to watch TV? If so, you might have left the keys by the TV. Or before going to the TV, did you plan to get a book and put it in your bag before going to work? Maybe you left the keys on the bookshelf. Go there to look. Ask your brain to forget all conscious thoughts of where keys are, and focus on searching in your subconscious. What was I doing? What was I thinking? Where was I just now? You will get your answer soon.

**8. Remembering Numbers**

Let's say you meet a friend and get their phone number, but you don’t have your phone or paper to write it down. You try to repeat the number in your head, but after a few minutes talking to another friend, you forget the number. Too bad, right? Now, I'll show you a method called Memory Pegs. It still uses association. I'll give you an example number to try: 5 3 7 8 4 7 1 2 6.

Okay, both you and I find that remembering plain numbers is not interesting or easy. Now, forget them. I need you to focus your brain now to get ready to imagine. Turn these lifeless numbers into lively images in your head. Ready to imagine with me?

- **Number 0:** Imagine it as a round chicken egg, big and round.
- **Number 1:** Think of a burning candle.
- **Number 2:** A duck.
- **Number 3:** A red heart.
- **Number 4:** A sailboat.
- **Number 5:** A pregnant woman.
- **Number 6:** An elephant.
- **Number 7:** A boomerang.
- **Number 8:** A snowman.
- **Number 9:** A balloon.

Okay, now try to review these in your head a few times, the images for numbers 0 to 9. This is just my suggestion; you can imagine any image that's easy for you to remember. Create your own peg library.

After we have an image library for numbers, and you can remember them easily, now let's go back to the number sequence from before: 5 3 7 8 4 7 1 2 6. It's time to start linking a story. Imagine with me:

- A **pregnant woman (5)** is walking heavily.
- Suddenly, she is scared. Her **heart (3)** beats fast because...
- A **boomerang (7)** is flying towards her!
- It turns out, over there is a **snowman (8)** who threw it.
- At this moment, the pregnant woman, with a mother's instinct, quickly ducks down.
- The **boomerang (7)** flies low over her head, straight out to sea.
- It tears a **sailboat’s sail (4)** of a boat docked nearby.
- The boat owner gets angry and throws the **boomerang (7)** back.
- Unexpectedly, it hits a giant **candle (1)** burning on the beach.
- Making it fall and start a fire around it.
- Burning a **duck (2)** and an **elephant (6)** nearby.

Now let’s review the story again: A pregnant woman walking heavily, suddenly scared because a boomerang is flying towards her, thrown by a snowman. The pregnant woman ducks, but the boomerang tears a sailboat’s sail. The angry boat owner throws the boomerang back, unexpectedly hitting a giant candle, making it fall and burn a duck and an elephant nearby.

Okay, now you can remember this story easily, right? Next, we will translate it back into the number sequence we need to remember. We have a pregnant woman walking - number 5. Heart beating fast - number 3. Boomerang flying - number 7. Snowman - number 8. Sailboat - number 4. Boomerang thrown back - number 7 again. Candle - number 1. Nướng chín (Vietnamese for “grilled, burned”) duck and elephant - number 2 and 6.

So, we got the number sequence 5 3 7 8 4 7 1 2 6. You can try to imagine and write this number sequence on paper to see if it’s right. See, if you really focused, you have successfully remembered this number sequence. Tomorrow, try to recall this story. I believe you will still remember it 100%. This is a simple example to show you how the Number Peg method works. You can also pair up two numbers as one image. Instead of just remembering 10 images, you can increase the number of images for pairs of numbers from 00 to 99, or link each pair to a familiar word that’s easy to remember or a meaningful event for you. You can increase your remembering speed and the length of number sequences you can remember significantly. You can use it to remember house numbers, birthdays, historical dates, bank account numbers, etc. Although explaining this method seems long and complicated, when you practice, these things only take seconds to happen in your brain. Believe me, practice it every day. Try a little each day with some phone numbers of your friends or family. Then, everyone will be amazed at your ability.

**Part 6: Increase Productivity in Studying and Exams**

Social norms from childhood teach us that studying early in the morning is effective. We are taught that quiet helps focus and that we must attend all classes. But in reality, when we belong to a norm or a community, we are individuals with diversity and differences from others. So, some norms are right for others but not for you.

**Green Time and Red Time**

Everyone has a peak time of day when their brain works best and memory is strongest. There are also times when you can’t focus or feel very tired. I call them Green Time and Red Time. Everyone knows their own Green Time and Red Time. Early birds’ peak time might be in the 2 hours after waking up. While night owls’ peak time is in the evening. If so, pay attention to times when you feel most energetic and use them well. Study and do creative brain work like writing, reading, homework in Green Time. On the other hand, in Red Time, do tasks that don't need much brain effort, like cleaning, organizing files, checking email. That's the time your brain is signaling you to stop.

When starting to work or study, don't start by reading hard and required materials. Using your brain is like other muscles; it needs to warm up before working at high intensity. As time passes, you feel yourself getting into a “green wave.” If you feel safe and flowing quickly with books and papers, keep going as long as possible. Don't break that wave. Use memory aids like highlighters and notebooks to write down and mark important parts. When you read a book or follow a lecture, find the main ideas and keywords that are the backbone to link to the main knowledge in the lesson.

Okay, here's the English translation of the text, keeping it simple and easy to understand:

**This will help you remember faster, easier, and reduce the amount you have to memorize, helping you learn more knowledge.**

**Rest**

If something happens that you can't control, like a friend visiting or a phone call, and your "green time" disappears, it's okay. Give yourself some time to rest. This is a good time because research shows that resting between learning sessions helps us remember better and learn new things easier. Instead of constantly burying yourself in books, your memory doesn't have a chance to work at its best when you lack sleep. So, if you decide to wake up early, go to bed early. If you have to stay up late to work, don't wake up early. I don't encourage you to oversleep, but what I'm saying is, choose a time to work that suits you and rest enough time for your brain to recover.

**Suitable Environment**

Everyone can focus in a different environment. For example, I can only focus in a quiet but airy environment, like in the backyard or on the porch. I can't stand sitting in a stuffy room with four walls. But for others, that's a very good place. Some people like to sit in a coffee shop where there's soft music and people talking quietly nearby. Others like to sit in the library, and so on. It doesn't matter where you study. Choose an environment for yourself where your brain can be comfortable and fully focused. Only you know what learning environment works best for you.

**Memory in Presentations**

I advise you to never memorize your speech word-for-word. This is because it's very easy to have a problem where, when you're speaking, you suddenly forget a word, and it makes you forget everything you need to say afterward. At this point, you'll become confused and like a broken record in front of everyone. The best way is not to do that. Use key words – important keywords – to link to the content you want to talk about. For example, if you're presenting about a new car model, there will be important keywords you need to mention, like car weight, acceleration ability, engine size, fuel consumption, new tire type, etc. Remembering these keywords will be shorter and much simpler. From these keywords, you'll easily know what to say and not be afraid of missing or saying things wrong. You can use the "Roman Room" method mentioned earlier to memorize or another method that's more effective in this case, which is "Location Method". Basically, it's similar to how "Roman Room" helps you remember, but the main difference is that instead of linking keywords with images in your imaginary room, "Location Method" directly uses objects and scenes in the room where you're presenting. This works if you know the place beforehand and are allowed to practice there before presenting. The objects right in front of you, catching your eye, will lead you to the associations you created earlier. Recalling the words you need to remember will definitely be easier then.

**Memory for Languages and Vocabulary**

I see many people cramming thousands of vocabulary words in a month just for exams and confidently believing that they can remember all of them. Oh no, they are only temporarily saved, and the forgetting curve will make you gradually forget them after the exam if they are not used. Is it true that after learning all the vocabulary in a month, if you go back and look at the vocabulary from the first day, you won't be able to accurately remember all of them? There will be words that feel vaguely familiar and known, but you can't remember their meanings. A few months later, maybe the effort you crammed in a month will become meaningless. You've forgotten almost everything you learned if not used. Vocabulary, like other things, if not moved into long-term memory and saved in your subconscious, you will quickly forget them. The best way to learn a language is to live where people speak that language. The environment forces you to be exposed and practice regularly, which will make you remember them better. If you don't have the opportunity to do that, at least have a group of friends where everyone only uses that language to talk. Don't be afraid of speaking wrongly. Consider yourself like children learning to speak, maybe clumsy, maybe broken and grammatically incorrect, but believe me, we are learning a language, not lecturing before academic professors. No one will care if you speak wrongly. And if they do, they will also help you correct them. They will still understand what you are saying, just like parents used to hear our baby babble but still knew what we wanted. The more you use the language, the faster you will learn it. In this part, the author briefly presents a method for quickly remembering vocabulary by breaking down words and association, but I think it's a bit difficult to apply for those who don't have a lot of vocabulary already, so I won't present it here.

**How to Remember a Person's Name**

Remembering other people's names helps us gain trust, increase self-confidence, avoid embarrassing situations, and develop focus ability. There are 3 essential steps to help us remember new people we meet:

**Step A: Before Meeting**

Recognize that you are going to meet a stranger and you must try to remember them. Most of us politely exchange names, but we often forget because we never pay attention to it. So, recognize that you are at an event and will meet many interesting and strange new people and you must remember their names. Repeat to yourself, "I'm going to an event with many interesting new people, and I must remember their names."

**Step B: Pay Attention to Each Person**

Pay attention to each person and repeat their name throughout the conversation. When you meet a stranger and need to exchange names, make sure you know and understand their name correctly. If you didn't hear clearly, don't hesitate to ask them to repeat it. When meeting a face that looks quite familiar, you should introduce your name first to avoid making them embarrassed because they may not remember you. Exchange business cards. Learn to remember names with the purpose of remembering it and repeating it verbally. Look carefully at the business card to know how to spell and pronounce their name correctly. They will feel more respected and cared for. Then, repeat their name throughout the conversation. This is a method to deeply imprint a network of associations into your memory.

"Sofia, I see you were eating peaches. Oh, can you keep the peach pit? I have a hobby of collecting peach pits in the living room." This is a clever joke to start a conversation. Ask important questions and look for interesting topics in the conversation. We will remember better about people we appreciate. Besides, we can take advantage of repeating everyone's names in your free time when quickly reviewing information related to that person from the business card they gave. Observe people carefully to be able to remember.

**Step C: Associate with Appearance**

The quickest way to connect with a name is to associate the name with their appearance. For example, if Thang is always happy and energetic, associate it with an image of him celebrating the victory of his favorite football team – "Thang - Victory". Or, if Khuyen is a small, cute, gentle girl, remember a very gentle, gentle girl – "Khuyen - Gentle". Reality shows that we remember names for many reasons: familiar names, names that are like someone else's name, common and repeated names. The first time we meet someone can also remind us of their name. So, there are many techniques to be able to remember names easily. Here are a few name and face memory techniques that I will list for you. You can search for them yourself on Google. Or if you want Radio Kết Nối to explain each technique specifically in future videos, please comment below this video to let me know.

- **Pinocchio Technique:** Some studies show that you can only accurately remember and build about 18 percent of a person's face if you just met them. However, there are points you can remember very accurately, such as face shape, hair, age, and unusual features. This is the key to remembering in this technique.
- **Caricature Technique:** Distorting or exaggerating a feature of a person's image will increase the accuracy in recognizing their face. If there are no noticeable features, you can associate the name with their clothes.
- **Matching Technique:** This technique is used when the person you meet looks like someone you know. You use this feature to match them and associate to be able to remember the name.
- **Napoleon Technique:** Napoleon Bonaparte used the method of writing a person's name on paper, looking at it for a few seconds, then he would focus on the person, look at them carefully, and imagine their name being engraved on their forehead.
- **GSP Technique:** This is a technique to group the first letters of names to be able to remember.
- **Location Technique:** Many studies show that people tend to remember others based on the location where they first met them. This method attaches location and setting information that you can easily remember to the person whose name you want to remember.

Yes, we have just learned about the super memory techniques of author Alan Katz. Do you think like me at this moment? Actually, these methods are not too scary at all. They are based on how our brain processes information, reacts, and remembers events to create techniques that make remembering effective and easier. When you practice fluently, you will achieve unexpected progress in your memory ability, just like Alan Katz. He has repeatedly confirmed to everyone that he is not a person with special abilities or superpowers, but no one believes him because the things he shows are too different from a normal person. Currently, you have grasped the techniques that he used. I believe that you can also completely do things like that.

Finally, this video was created with the aim of conveying the most concise and useful memory techniques to everyone, helping everyone understand the importance of memory, wrong ideas about your memory, and understand that you can completely change it by practicing it right now. This video cannot describe all the techniques and cannot replace the experience of reading the book. If anyone wants to learn more thoroughly, you can order the book "The Secret of a Super Memory" by author Alan Katz to read.
