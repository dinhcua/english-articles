**The Real Value of Learning English**

Maybe you have heard people say "learn English to be successful" or "learn English to get a good job." But have you ever asked yourself, is success just about knowing grammar and words from books? Think about the great things life teaches us every day. These lessons are not in books, but they help us know ourselves and the world better. Come with me on a trip to find out the real value of learning English. Here, questions like "Why am I learning English?" and "How can English help me make a difference?" will become keys to open doors to success and happiness.

Today, I want to share a new way to see learning English, success, and happiness. These are important things we often forget when we only focus on school knowledge. In this article, I will share stories, my own experiences, and ways to help us not just "escape being poor" in chances, but also find ourselves and make a meaningful life with English. Let’s open our eyes and hearts to see that learning English is not just about grades or certificates. It's about growing and finding yourself.

We often just "cram" words and grammar. We focus only on remembering and forget that we need to understand and use knowledge. Learning English well is about learning deeply, thinking, and connecting new things with what we already know. One helpful way I believe in is the L-I-A-R plan, made for learning English.

First, **L. Listen & Learn**. This is when you write down what you learn from lessons, books, apps, or any English learning stuff. Don't just listen or read without thinking. Write down the important things.

- **Example for words:** When you listen to an English podcast, **write down** new words and **write** the example sentence the speaker uses.
- **Example for grammar:** When you read a grammar book, **write notes** about grammar rules, **draw** sentence structure diagrams, or **write short notes** about how to use a new tense.
- **Example for listening practice:** Watch an English lesson video and **write down** main ideas, **important words**, or **things you find interesting**.
- **Example for speaking practice:** After watching a sample talk, **write down** good phrases, **useful sentence structures** that you want to learn.

Next is **I. Inquire (Ask & Wonder)**. This is when you ask questions about things you don’t understand or want to know more about. Don’t be afraid to ask "Why?" or "How?". Only by asking questions can you learn more about it.

- **Example for words:** **Ask**, "Are there other ways to use this word?", "What are similar and opposite words?", or "**Why** does this word have this meaning?".
- **Example for grammar:** **Ask**, "**Why** is this tense used in this sentence?", "Are there other rules about this structure?", or "**How** to tell this structure apart from a similar one?".
- **Example for listening practice:** **Ask** yourself, "**Why** can't I hear this part clearly?", "Which **words** did I not recognize?", or "**How** to get better at hearing these sounds?".
- **Example for speaking practice:** **Ask** your teacher or friends, "**Does this sound natural?", "Is there a better way to say this?", or "**How\*\* can I speak more smoothly in this situation?".

**A. Apply (Use It)**. This is when you use your knowledge in practice. After understanding and asking questions, don't just stop at remembering. Try to use the knowledge in real situations.

- **Example for words:** **Use** new words by **making sentences** with them, **writing short paragraphs** using new words, or **try to use** new words when talking.
- **Example for grammar:** **Use** new grammar structures by **doing grammar exercises**, **writing emails** or **essays** using that structure, or **try to use** that structure when speaking.
- **Example for listening practice:** **Use** listening skills by **listening to many kinds of materials** (podcasts, movies, music, news), **join English clubs** to hear native speakers, or **watch movies without subtitles** to challenge yourself.
- **Example for speaking practice:** **Use** speaking skills by **joining speaking practice groups**, **giving talks in English**, **record your own voice** and listen back, or **find chances to talk to foreigners**.

Finally, **R. Reflect (Think & Judge)**. Take time to think about and judge what you have learned. This is important so you don't just remember knowledge, but also grow thinking skills and learn how to learn by yourself. After each lesson, ask yourself deeply with these example questions:

- **What did I learn today?** (List new knowledge, words, grammar structures that you learned).
- **How does this knowledge really help me?** (Think about real uses, can it help you at work, school, talking to people, or hobbies?).
- **What problems did I have in this lesson?** (Find the parts you found hard, didn’t understand well, or made mistakes in).
- **How did I get over those problems?** (Remember how you found solutions, like re-reading materials, asking teachers, friends, or searching online).
- **Where else can I use this knowledge besides the examples?** (Think widely about uses, find other real situations where you can use this knowledge).
- **What can I do better next time?** (Make a plan for the next steps, find things to focus on to learn better).

Sometimes we think learning English a lot is enough, but it’s not. Learning deeply and using new knowledge is the real way to learn English well. We can't just look at theory; we have to practice in daily life. **When learning English, you might have problems like losing motivation when progress is slow, feeling awkward when speaking, or having trouble remembering words.** But the L-I-A-R method can help you get through these challenges. **Listen & Learn** helps you take in knowledge actively; **Inquire** encourages you to ask questions to understand deeper; **Apply** helps you turn knowledge into real skills; and **Reflect** helps you see your strengths, weaknesses and change your learning in a good way. Remember, this English knowledge will not only help you get your dream job but also help you find your own worth and hidden abilities.

For example, you learn how to write a professional email in English but never used it in real life. When you try to write a work email in English, you will see that what you learned is not just theory but a useful tool to make your talking and work better.

Not all lessons come from books. Lessons about change, accepting mistakes, and trying hard in life are also important when learning English. Remember that every step, no matter how small, helps you get closer to your goal. Even if it's just **learning 5 new words each day, practicing pronunciation for 10 minutes a day, finishing a small grammar exercise, watching a short English video, or confidently talking to a foreigner even with just a few sentences**, all these “small wins” help make big changes and build your confidence.

To change, you must start with yourself. Try small changes in how you learn English and keep improving every day. Trying hard and putting in effort will help you build lasting success in learning this language.

“Success” in learning English does not come from big jumps, but is built from small, consistent efforts over time. Each day, a small step can lead you to achievements beyond what you expect. Start with simple things like spending a few minutes each day learning new words, practicing pronunciation in front of a mirror, or reading a short English text each day. These “small wins” will make a strong base for long-term growth.

So, we have gone together from the first thought of “learn English to get a good job” to finding the real value of learning English – a journey of finding yourself, passion, and growth. Valuable lessons come not just from books but also from life experiences, mistakes, and quiet moments of thinking during learning.
