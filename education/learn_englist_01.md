**Problem: Not Good Ways to Learn**

- **1. Passive Learning (only read, watch):**

  - **Explain:** This way to learn is like you are just watching. You only read books or watch videos, but you don't really _join_ in learning. Like watching a football game, you know the rules, but you don't really know how to play if you don't play yourself.
  - **Example:** You only read a grammar book from start to finish without doing exercises. Or you watch English learning videos for one hour but only watch, no notes, no practice.
  - **Why not good:** When you learn passively, you don't remember for long and don't really understand well. Knowledge only "goes through" you, not "stays" in your head. You don't really _use_ that knowledge.

- **2. No Active Practice (speak, write, listen):**

  - **Explain:** Learning a language is like learning to swim or drive. You can't learn to swim only by reading books about swimming. You need to go to the water and practice. Same, you learn English but don't speak, write, listen, it's like learning to swim on land, not real.
  - **Example:** You learn many words and grammar, but you don't want to speak English, never write English sentences, or don't listen to English podcasts.
  - **Why not good:** Speaking, writing, listening are ways to really _use_ English, change knowledge into skills. If no practice, you are not confident to talk and your skills don't grow.

- **3. Too Much Focus on Grammar, No Use:**

  - **Explain:** Grammar is like the bones of language, it's important, but not all. If you only learn grammar rules and don't _use_ grammar to speak, write, it's like you have good bones but no muscles to move.
  - **Example:** You learn all tenses in English, do grammar exercises very well, but when you talk, you are slow, don't know which tense to use, or talk very slowly because you think too much about grammar.
  - **Why not good:** The main goal to learn a language is to talk. If you only good at grammar but can't talk, learning grammar is not useful.

- **4. Only Use One Learning Material:**
  - **Explain:** Like you only eat one food every day, even if it's good, you get bored and don't get enough food types. Learn English same, if you only use one book, you are limited with words, ways to say, and don't hear many voices, styles.
  - **Example:** You only learn with books at school, don't read stories, don't watch movies, don't listen to English music.
  - **Why not good:** Use many learning materials help you learn many words, grammar in different situations, know many language styles, and make learning more fun.

**Solutions: Change to Active Learning**

- **1. Practice Speaking, Writing, Listening Actively:**

  - **How to do:** Try to make chances to speak, write, listen to English every day.
    - **Speak:** Practice talking with friends who learn English, join English clubs, practice speaking alone to a mirror, or record your voice.
    - **Write:** Write English diary, write emails to international friends (if have), write comments on English forums, or practice writing short sentences about things you like.
    - **Listen:** Listen to English podcasts, listen to English music, watch movies, English videos with subtitles (first can watch with Vietnamese subtitles, then change to English subtitles, then no subtitles).
  - **Why good:** Active practice helps you change passive knowledge into real skills, helps you feel more confident when you use English, and helps you remember longer.

- **2. Learn Words in Context:**

  - **How to do:** Instead of learning words in long lists, learn words when you see them in reading, listening, or in movies. Write down the sentence or small part of text that has the word to understand how to use the word in context.
  - **Example:** When you read an English news article and see the word "excited", instead of just write "excited = hào hứng", write down the sentence "She was very excited about the trip" and learn how to use "excited" in this sentence.
  - **Why good:** Learn words in context help you understand the meaning clearly, how to use the word, and remember words easier. You also learn how words go together in sentences naturally.

- **3. Use Many Learning Materials:**
  - **How to do:** Use many kinds of learning materials to make learning not boring and more useful.
    - **Textbooks:** Still needed to have good basic knowledge.
    - **Workbooks:** To practice grammar and words.
    - **English stories, novels:** To learn words and grammar in a natural, fun way.
    - **English newspapers, magazines:** To know news and learn everyday language.
    - **English movies, videos, TV shows:** To practice listening and learn natural talking.
    - **English podcasts, music:** To practice listening anytime, anywhere.
    - **English learning apps:** To learn words, grammar, practice speaking in a easy way.
  - **Why good:** Use many learning materials help you know many language styles, many topics, help you learn many skills and knowledge in a full way, and make learning fun, not boring.
